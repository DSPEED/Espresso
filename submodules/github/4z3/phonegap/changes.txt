Bryce Curtis (199):
      Change accelerometer to use JavaScript setInterval for watch.
      Accelerometer updates:     - Removed thread delay to get accelerometer values.     - Override Activity lifecycle methods to manage JavaScript timers and enable window.onunload to be called.  This is needed for accelerometer to shut down correctly.
      Add XHR-based callbacks from Java to JavaScript.
      Add callback server class.
      Change loadUrl(javascript...) to use new callback mechanism.
      Add onpause & onresume events to javascript.
      Change compass listener and optimize accelerometer listener.
      Make sure JavaScript PhoneGap code is initialized and deviceready is fired for a new HTML page loaded from link in initial index.html.
      Don't need to fire native ready event during constructor.  It gets fired when page has been loaded.
      Change resume and pause to use same event mechanism used by deviceready.
      Set type of channel.
      Don't need to manage resume/pause state - the OS does it.
      Update audio playback and recording.
      Moved camera code from DroidGap into CameraLauncher.  Added comments and error messages.
      Add automatic handling of onActivityResult, so modules that start activities with result callback can do so without modifying DroidGap.java.

      Start CameraLauncher using module.
      Set default camera image to base64.  Add comments.

      Implement ReturnValue() for each plugin.
      Optimize compass to use new PluginManager.
      Add position callback and do some optimization of audio player.
      Optimize accelerometer to use new PluginManager.
      Modify network queries to use async plugin.
      Modify camera capture to use async plugin.  Use option instead of method to specify capture type (base64 or file).
      Modify contacts to use async plugin.  Contacts doesn't work on Android, but needed to update JS side to work with plugin.
      JS execAsync to handle changes to plugins.
      Modify JS code to use service name rather than class name.
      Clean up unused variables.
      Change hasReturnValue to isSynch to be more accurate about purpose of method.
      Add JSON stringify equivalent not implemented in older Android (1.6) devices.  This is needed for args passed to PhoneGap.exec().
      Use timeout to break out of possible infinite loop waiting for sensor to start.

      Read and write operations are async.
      FileWriter should use its own states object.
      Device returns string, but for some reason emulator returns object - so convert to string.
      Fix problem with deviceready being called before device properties are guaranteed to be set.
      Need to listen for XHR callbacks before constructors are run, since constructors could call native code that returns data in callback.
      Added comments.
      Change isReachable() to return NetworkStatus constant to reachableCallback(reachability) as specified in the API documentation.
      Update geolocation to follow W3C spec, add comments, add error checking.
      Add geolocation options as defined by W3C spec.
      Update notification service to implement plugin class.
      Update lastAccessTime when calling getAcceleration() so we don't timeout.

      Check plugin against new Plugin and IPlugin to determine if valid plugin class.
      Remove getClassForService() and make addPlugin() private.
      Change initialization of Storage for 1.x devices to use service call.
      Add callbackId to Plugin.execute() so result can be sent back when overlapping calls to same plugin occur.
      Update alert() to implement navigator.notification.alert API.  This update is from janmonschke (Jan Monschke).
      Add confirm, start/stopActivity, start/stopProgress to notification service.  Add "application loading" spinner that user can optionally show when app is starting.

      Fix variable change error.
      Add error checking around user callbacks.
      Rename PhoneGap.execAsync() to PhoneGap.exec() and change all JS files that use it.
      Rename PhoneGap.execAsync() to PhoneGap.exec().
      Made notification.alert and notification.confirm async.
      Add PluginResult status values to handle RESULT_TO_BE_SENT, NEXT_RESULT, NO_MORE_RESULTS .
      Alert and notification dialogs should be run on UI thread.
      Add quotes when returning status message.
      Use polling instead of XHR for callbacks from Java to JavaScript when device has a proxy set.

      Load url into DroidGap if it was passed in to intent.
      Add method for dynamic loading of a JavaScript file.
      Use polling if PhoneGap app is loaded from server, since XHR doesn't work to localhost due to cross-domain security policy.
      Add properties to DroidGap that can be set when the intent/activity is called.  This enables the developer to show app loading dialog,  splashscreen, or set other properties.
      Fix formatting and rearrange method order.
      Add comments to onKeyDown() method.
      Merged code for imhotep: Cleaner way for handling splashscreens.

      Fix bug when not doing cast - temp isn't defined.
      Define window.plugins object so plugins can check to see if they have already been created.
      Remove comment for unused parameter.
      Improve handling of timeout error when loading URL, and enable WebViewClient to be overridden by app, so developer can intercept webview events.
      Don't need special method to load a splash screen.  Instead, the regular loadUrl() and clearHistory() can be used.
      Expose certain methods from DroidGap to JavaScript so that a PhoneGap web app can better control program configuration and flow.
      Update splash screen example and list of properties that can be set in commented code.
      Add JavaScript minification using YUICompressor.
      Update comments.
      Need license header since it is removed by minification.
      Fix bug with saving name in new contact.
      Update version number to 0.9.3 in preparation for next release.
      If multitasking is turned on (keepRunning=true), then temporarily disable it when starting a new activity that returns a result - such as camera.
      Re-enable multitasking in onResume Java callback so that onResume JS handlers are called - it was being re-enabled too soon.
      Support all URIs by passing them to their default activity.  This works for market:// and content://.
      Better memory management when taking pictures.
      Allow features/modules to initialize code before deviceready fires.  CupcakeLocalStorage uses this capability to delay deviceready until local storage has been read and inited.
      Ticket 63: Android CallbackServer crashes on external attacks.
      Skip over beginning / in request when comparing to token.
      Disable picture listener once event has occurred.
      Change super.setProperty() to use super.set<type>Property() in example comments.
      Logging status from wrong object.
      Worked around JavaScript bridge exception for Android 2.3.  Use "prompt" instead of calling objects directly.  There were several objects called from JavaScript, including BrowserKey, so key events had to be reworked.
      Ticket 106 - Simplify splash screen logic based upon idea from vadim.
      Add support for setting sms body using uri "sms:#?body=text".

      Need to unregister for network intent receiver on shutdown to prevent leaks.
      Set PhoneGap.UsePolling flag based upon result from CallbackServer.
      Fix security vulnerability - make sure any requests to run native code only come from url currently loaded into webview.
      Issue 112: PhoneGap.Channel: replace instanceof Function with typeof === 'Function'
      Urls with same path and file but different # or ? should compare to same url.
      Return true when handling key events, indicating that no further processing is necessary.
      Always call plugin's onPause/onResume with multitasking flag when these lifecycle events occur in activity.  It is up to the plugin to handle as necessary.

      Bump up version to 0.9.6 for example.
      Update version to 0.9.6.1
      Loading plugins from res/xml/plugins.xml
      Copy plugins.xml when creating a new project.
      Remove unused code and variable.
      Accept IPlugin for result callback when starting activities for result.
      Change to PhoneGap naming convention affects droidgap creation & update.  Also, create script uses phonegap-x.js, not phonegap-x.min.js.
      Remove dependency on notification.activityStart/Stop so they can be deprecated to an optional plugin.  Also remove hideLoadingDialogOnPage option, since it no longer is relevant.
      Make sure we load the correct resource id for plugins.xml.
      Shouldn't return error on first call.  This prevents successful invocation, which prevents deviceready from firing.
      Use the same database based upon application context for each html page loaded as part of this app.
      Replace deprecated call to activityStop.
      Remove deprecated addService() method.  The new way to register a plugin is to include it in res/xml/plugins.xml.
      Issue #154: Propagate existing parameters when starting new DroidGap activity.

      Cleanup formatting.
      Remove lingering code for old 1.x support.
      White list support.   Pull request https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-android/pull/211 from imhotep would not merge, so combined it with enhancements for this commit.
      Clean up code that loads sub-pages and correct behavior.
      Clean up code and consolidate bindBrowser with init.
      Add comment for method onOverrideUrlLoading()
      When app.exitApp() is called on multi-page app, pass to previous pages in stack and close them too.

Fil Maj (27):
      Added fail callback to Android GpsListener/GeoListener.
      Updated URI usage in Blackberry PhoneGap. Located line of code that is likely causing the BrowserContentManager to freeze when it is using the "experimental" 17000 rendering mode option. Finally, added META tag directive as suggested by RIM (does not work, but RIM says to do it, so I did!).
      ContactManager tweaks; null/empty checks to eliminate NullPointerException.
      Fix for specifying icon in config.xml; the @icon attribute would get overriden by defaults when going from create => classic::build.
      Getting rid of black screen between native loading screen and actual PhoneGap app.
      Fix for ticket #55: if phonegap source was on a path with "bin" in it would cause major fail.
      Ticket 80: running "droidgap gen example" leads to recursive directory creation. README fix included.
      Ticket 81: Tweak to label of local path to index.html in example app, now properly shows actual project-relative path.

      Syntax fixes to my ruby :P
      Fix so that if not all icons are specified, doesnt error the build out.
      Use icon with no width/height if specified. Set default icon to highest-resolution icon when possible.
      Issue 107: Always send pause event to JS.
      Issue 107: always send resume event to JS.
      Null check in droidgap classic (build script).
      As best a fix as can be made for issue 95: on HTC devices, if text input is in bottom half of page, it does not get scrolled up to top half of page when you tap it and virtual keyboard comes up.
      Fix for lighthouse ticket 115: certain versions of Android 2.2 return "null" for window.openDatabase. Hook in PhoneGap fallback for storage in this case.
      Fix for ticket 121: Checking for null return on native openDatabase call not enough as only allowed one DB per PhoneGap app. Have to proxy openDatabase and check at runtime.

      Updating the Android permissions so we can access all the info we need
      Forgot to move the manifest to the branch
      Added helpers to make life easier
      Latest PhoneGap Source

Mark Darbyshire (1):
      Implement localStorage.key() and localStorage.length     This brings PhoneGap's implementation in line with the spec at http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/     It makes the following demo work when you include PhoneGap: http://people.w3.org/mike/localstorage.html     I was hopeful it would make my app, which makes use of LawnChair, work, but I've had no such luck as of yet.

Matt Kane (5):
      Change use "geo:" instead of WebView.SCHEME_GEO
      This is being called from java code, but callback didn't exist

filmaj (16):
      Updated build file after mergin in thorstens changes.
      Added JS concatenation and copy over to assets/www to build script.
      Fixed building of phonegap.js in build script. Fixed GPS on Android 2.0+ - I guess they updated the version of WebKit being used on Android (similar now to how it works on iPhone) and thus the browser has a native navigator.geolocation object. Employed Jesse`s approach to proxying an object`s method since we can`t directly overwrite it.
      Fixed small contacts and accelerometer object instantiation bugs. Added a bit more delay to PhoneGap constructor, 1ms caused issues sometimes I *think*.
      Added ARenzi`s Reachability fixes.
      Oops forgot semi-colon.
      More weird merge bs.
      Tweaked status message.
      Adding newly-built phonegap.js to repo post-build.
      Fixed droidgap to handle spaces in SDK directory.
      Minor changes to droidgap to make it work on my shell (cygwin), merging in Joe`s changes/fixes to geo + JavaScript
      Added explicit disabling of native Geolocation object in the web client, added a fallback measure to JavaScript geolocation PhoneGap constructor so that it builds/proxies the the instantiated Geo objects properly if it still does exist.
      Semi-colon + new-line addition otherwise built phonegap.js is bad :(
      For some reason have to check typeof?
      Don`t hardcode the android sdk path in the build script before you push (im looking at you Dave)
      Was there a reason we had some code duplication?

Devon Weller (1):
      Added phoneGapVersion method to read version from the VERSION file.  deviceProperties now uses this this instead of a hard-coded value.

Fil Maj (108):
      Added fail callback to Android GpsListener/GeoListener.
      Updated URI usage in Blackberry PhoneGap. Located line of code that is likely causing the BrowserContentManager to freeze when it is using the "experimental" 17000 rendering mode option. Finally, added META tag directive as suggested by RIM (does not work, but RIM says to do it, so I did!).
      Commented out experimental rendering mode until we figure out how to load web pages in it with it properly.
      PhoneGap Blackberry working with proper Blackberry browser rendering! Changed PhoneGap Blackberry approach from using BrowserContentManager class to a Field class object. Much more low-level definition/control over HttpConnection object associated with PhoneGap. Still needs some work: cookies need to be enabled and PhoneGap callbacks hooked in properly to cookies.
      BlackBerry PhoneGap updated, lots of changes. Changed from BrowserContentManager to Browser.Field object as browser wrapper. Started to port all PhoneGap API calls to cookies (since at the moment we cant catch gap:// URI calls properly).
      Fixed/added notification.beep support.
      Renamed some native classes for BlackBerry PhoneGap, added proper support for geolocation, device and notification (based on PhoneGap spec).
      Updated gitignore
      Added Media support for PhoneGap BlackBerry, extended demo app to use Media API, added media files.
      Updated Contacts to work with PhoneGap BlackBerry. Following Shazrons lead on the JS API for the contacts with respect to parameters.
      Updated BB gitignore
      Updated BlackBerry PhoneGap project file (phonegap.jdp), added a test CSS file, fixed stylesheet retrieval and injection (css works now).
      Updated telephony API calls - works now :)
      Updated Contacts, now has chooseContact method (which will invoke stock BlackBerry contact list chooser).
      Updated JS for BlackBerry.
      Added initial repository for Windows Mobile - only a couple of device functionalities work right now. Also updated JS for BlackBerry.
      Added basic media support (WAV and MP3 for now) and updated demo to reflect.
      BlackBerry: Finished implementing newContact.
      Updated Contacts - fixed bugs related to devices not having all PIM contact instance fields.
      Fixed tearing/rendering issues experienced on-device by forcing a Browser Field redraw on a Timer Task.
      Fixed a couple of minor bugs (PhoneGap member visibility and CommandManager instantiation).
      Modified PhoneGap BlackBerry so that relative URLs work. No longer need to prefix local resource URLs with data:// URIs.
      Added MD5 hashing to directory reference hash for memory optimization, piggy-backed on Tim W Macinta`s MD5 implementation for Java. Added a couple of function headers to ConnectionManager.
      Removed old unused command.
      Added Network command to BlackBerry branch, which implements a reachability API. Allows users to check if a network connection (either via WiFi or carrier-based networks) is available.
      Added network API JavaScript for PhoneGap BlackBerry.
      Added full function headers for ConnectionManager, re-organized and renamed some functions, added own history and cache implementations, turned a lot of string resources into static constants for slight performance improvement.
      Cleaned up PhoneGap BlackBerry I/O classes. Added more function header documentation to PhoneGap.java, hooked in the history stack implementation in ConnectionManager to a private KeyListener class, which triggers on the hardware `Back` button present in all BlackBerry devices.
      Tiny static string constant optimization in CommandManager
      Removed duplicate Initialization command. Added basic XHR support via the Network command. Finalized some string values in Media command.
      Cleaned up Contacts, Device and GeoLocation API functionality implementation classes, and updated the proper device javascript file.
      Updated BlackBerry JavaScript implementation to better fit with the base JavaScript files.
      Added Network JS implementation. For now, XHR is implemented using custom function - see navigator.network.XHR. This will probably change to try to mimic the old-fashioned XHR we`re all used to down the road.
      Fixed minor syntax errors.
      Slowly fixing the build process for the JavaScripts for BlackBerry, up to geolocation now. Added an example page for network functionality (reachability, XHR functionality).
      Updated project file to correctly include MD5 hashing code and the new NetworkCommand (oops).
      Removed unused import.
      Hooked in error callback when GPS listener returns out-of-service status for BlackBerry.
      Tweaked makefile for BlackBerry, added stub of compass support (not implemented yet, but soon!) and updated project file to reflect this.
      Finalized build process for PhoneGap.js for BlackBerry. Realized that SMS implementation is missing!
      Removed the old sample and used the stock PhoneGap sample for BlackBerry. Added built BlackBerry javascript to sample folder (www). Updated a bunch of the javascript API to work properly!
      Updated project file to include new sample www assets.
      Fixed bad semi-colon / line breaks in javascripts which caused build to fail.

      Fixed bad semi-colon / line breaks in javascripts which caused build to fail.
      Added some error handling/messages to XHR implementation, tweaked some of the request headers to conform to suggestions from RIM knowledge base articles regarding proxy communication on BlackBerry, and some of the message transcoding the RIM gateways do.
      Adding JS files for SMS functionality added by hemisphire. Tweaked makefile for that addition too.
      Changed JavaScript build to stop using the shared JavaScript. We`re moving over to using the mobile-spec to make sure the interface is consistent, and letting each platform do its own thing.
      Moved JavaScripts out of shared folder into blackberry folder. Added own blackberry makefile (for now - eventually will get an Ant task to build the entire project into binaries)
      ContactManager tweaks; null/empty checks to eliminate NullPointerException.
      Removed dependency on util folder (YUI compressor) from BlackBerry makefile.
      Updated README, removed old readme files.
      Tweaked telephony "send" method to have proper name as per mobile-spec (woo the spec actually works!). Also tweaked Position JS object (unnecessary parameter).
      Tweaked PhoneGap BlackBerry Contacts API to be named properly (AddressBook, not ContactManager).
      Tweaked minor changes to contacts API, lined up JS API to closer to mobile spec.
      Updated geolocation JavaScript API - it was broken!
      Fixed to BlackBerry native code for GeoLocation functionality.
      Updated Contacts JS API with proper find method and filter parameter.
      Updated Contacts API following the contacts API review meeting. Now should properly return new Contacts interface-based objects.
      Added build.xml to PhoneGap BlackBerry repository. Allows you to build BlackBerry application binaries from source using Apache Ant and BB Ant Tools (google it).
      Updated README with new Ant build instructions, expanded instructions on setting up fresh BlackBerry project in Eclipse.
      Fixed build script.
      Tweaked build script to launch simulator properly now. Added more directions and clarification to BlackBerry readme.
      Fixed bad instantiation of Geo command.
      Added property in BlackBerry build.xml to specify application name.
      How many times do I have to fix the casing on the Device JS object?
      Stop with the upper-case device labels!
      Added an extra "clean" task to build.xml.
      Removed stubs of accelerometer and orientation support (no one wants annoying alerts anyways).
      Removed the Eclipse project file and re-added it, since there are reports of not all files being included. Started to change the audio API over closer to HTML 5 approach, moved the geo map command into its own JS namespace.

Fred Grott (12):

      DroidGap.java changed to support demo2 inclusion
      added iBug from JoeHewitt.com support so can further debug the js
      start adding stuff and alerts to debug GPS, PLaySOund, and Accelerometer and PhoneGap.java corrected to match my Gap.js changes
      more changes to debug GPS
      half GPS problems fixed..Device.Location.init works nd can get first GPS read
      added phonegap icon to demo2
      one panel is user updates GPS other is automaic via pollling
      created some new functions to enale GPS/Accel value polling. GPS wise demo2 was changed so that we can do both change GPS in non gps suported cases and in GPS supported cases red Gps via polling

Igor Faletski (4):
      Changes required for AppStore approval:
      TransLink-specific changes

Jesse (15):
      FileAPI 0.9.3
      FileAPI 0.9.3
      allow loading a start page from a network location
      Splitting functionality out of core project.
      ignore generated js
      added gitignore for phonegap-uncompressed.js
      allow http: and https: URLs     - mailto: tel: sms: facetime: .... will all be passed to Application
      Added more informative log when unrecognized url sent to shouldStartLoadWithRequest.     Logs the actual url requested instead of just the description.
      20 px size defect fix
      Added Javascript Callback shouldRotateToOrientation which is called before looking up supportedOrientations in the plist. shouldRotateToOrientation should return true or false depending on it's current state/preference. shouldRotateToOrientation is expected to exist in the global scope.
      Fixed setAutoresizingMask. It was accessed as a method when it is a property.
      Testing branching
      Lifecycle events pause/resume
      Orientation issue : should always return YES for at least one orientation.
      Anchor tags with target="_blank" will correctly open in MobileSafari.     Targets of _self or _top will open in the app.     If target is NOT specified, it will open in the app.

Jesse MacFadyen (28):
      Accelerometer command
      Accel start and stop messages, removed global PhoneGapDelegate accel instance and made Accelerometer a full fledged command.
      Accel start and stop messages, removed global PhoneGapDelegate accel instance and made Accelerometer a full fledged command.
      Restructured initialization of device to ensure phonegap available when navigating between pages.  Implemented the 'deviceready' event, do not expect any phonegap exec calls to be executed until the deviceready event has been fired.  Use this: document.addEventListener('deviceready',YOUR_INIT_FUNCTION ,false);
      File API for iPhone ( text-mode only )
      Removed redundant code from template for new users, added device ready listening
      Added tutorial for demonstrating Gap functionality
      Updated to conform to MobileSpec.  navigator.ContactManager becomes navigator.contacts
      navigator.ContactManager becomes navigator.contacts
      Was crashing on second page load, value had been released
      Fix for geolocation object not functioning as expected in iPhone SDK 3.X
      Updated tutorial to include Form input fields + sound playback
      Updated tutorial to include Form input fields + sound playback
      BugFix: Was not working when called multiple times
      BugFix: Replaces MobileSafari's implementation with our own.     ( No more super long page path in the Allow/Deny prompt )     Can be called multiple times, was failing.
      Removing hacky _accel object dependency
      callback calls method on navigator.accelerometer object instead of hacky global _accel object
      I'm dumb, nice recursive constructor error I created there.
      Removed ref to Device::PhoneGapCommand as it was not a 'true' command and had a reverse dependency on PhoneGapDelegate.
      added deviceProperties method, removing Device Command
      <none>
      consolidated duplicate GetFunctionName calls and add anom function helper
      Added confirm method to supplement alert, both call the same native code, confirm expects buttonLabel to be a comma delim list of labels.  Returns a delegate that you can use to callback your own code and determin which button the user chose.
      added optional param to camera.getPicture to allow editing : options:{allowEdit:true}     The user will see a crop dialog after chosing the image, this is a good way to restrict huge files from the library.
      Errors were not being handled properly. lastPosition was null but this was still considered a success state.     Added getCurrentPosition option:     forcePrompt:Boolean default false ( iPhone Only! )     If your application is useless without GeoLocation, then you can let iPhone show the prompt with the button to jump straight to Settings->General->Location Services.

      Fixed Device.exec call changes I had forgotten to merge in
      Apparently Mobile Safari sets window.console, but doesn't do anything with it
      Fixed the merge from the sintaxi branch
      Refactored to use more configurable options in Settings.plist including rotation control, add console.* commands
      Updated Rakefile to build separate libs for each platform; previously it just walked all over each other, and the last one won
      Update the javascript to not walk over each other when initialized, made queued command dispatch work, added console actions

      Got setting tab items working
      Tab item callbacks fired when items are selected
      Moved docs into javascripts directory and updated README file

      Added UIControls.selectTabBarItem and its associated documentation
      Since course / speed are only supported in iPhone OS 2.2 and above, check the version number first
      Fixed $(SRCROOT) if it has spaces in its path
      Integrated bug fixes from J. Matthew Pryor; thanks!
      Factored out loading PList files into a method

      Extended konobi's build-time XCode script to build JavaScript sources.     Added a "configure" script to generate a Makefile which builds the necessary     JavaScript libraries in a clean fashion, keeping in mind dependancy change times.     So therefore it will rebuild only the files needed when a "make" is run.     Makes documentation as well, now in "docs/javascript".
      Added support for generating Doxygen documentation for the iPhone classes
      Added doxygen.cfg file; whoops, forgot

      Only generate Doxygen Makefile section if doxygen is installed
      (hopefully) fixed a bug in command queue handling
      Removed "online" mode, and cleaned up the source tree a little
      Got the device refactor working on the device

      - loadView doesn't get called when loading from nib/xib. Instead viewDidLoad is what gets called     - added an autorotate flag to enable/disable autorotate
      Updated application settings     - Changed String/Numbers in Settings.plist to booleans (where they were booleans)     - Added new settings: useLocation, useAccellerometer, autorotate (so if your app doesn't use the location service, it doesn't get initialized and you don't get the annoying "the app wants to use the location service" popup)

      Created PhoneGap Static framework (source files right now link off PhoneGapLib). Just drag and drop in to your Frameworks folder and in your Target/Link With Libraries. You must manually include "phonegap.X.X.X.js" in your www folder.
